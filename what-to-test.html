GyPTix application test plan:

- Using suggestions to generate new conversations
- Clicking the new conversation button in the top right to cycle suggestions
- Continuing conversations by asking meaningful follow-up questions
- Verifying that the conversation title is appropriate
- Confirming that titles appear in the History section (☰ hamburger button on the top left)
- Renaming, searching, and deleting conversations via the blue ⌄ button
  invoking the menu next to the conversation title in the History view and
  selecting Rename or Delete from the menu
- Loading previous conversations and continuing the discussion
- Bringing other GPU-intensive applications (e.g. YouTube) to the foreground during generation
- Returning to the GyPTix application and ensuring generation continues uninterrupted
- Using the stop button (square, bottom left) to interrupt generation and then the continue → button to resume
- Verifying that the font size buttons (a and A) and theme toggle (◐ dark/light) work in the History view
- Verifying that the info ⓘ and shred (♽) buttons function correctly in the History view
- Ensuring text selection and copy to clipboard work as expected
- On iPad, checking functionality in both portrait and landscape orientations
- On iPad, testing support for external USB and Bluetooth keyboards
- On macOS, verifying that window resizing works properly
- Generating list-based prompts (e.g. “List of the best movies of all time”) to check for infinite generation loops
- Killing the app mid-generation to ensure it handles abrupt termination gracefully
- Scrolling to the top and bottom (using scroll buttons and manual scrolling) during generation to verify smooth behavior
- Attempt to break out of 4096 tokens context window - keep pasting
  "Tell me more" as a follow-up question several times
  till the conversation grows really long
- Verify that after loading a conversation from history the model still
  remembers the topic when prompted
  "Generate brief summary of this conversation"
- Try HTML polutted input field: "\<a href="google.com"\>Hello there\</a\>"
- Any other usage scenarious you can come up with
